# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This is a beginner-level machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using **Linear Regression**. The project is built using a dummy dataset to understand the foundational concepts of regression modeling in a simplified environment.

<br/>

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a basic **Linear Regression** model works — using a clean, easy-to-understand dataset. While the dataset does not reflect real-world housing complexities, it is ideal for learning and experimentation.

Key Highlights:
- Implemented a supervised learning model using `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn`
- Visualized relationships between variables using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`
- Interpreted regression coefficients and model performance

<br/>

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – for model building and evaluation

## 📈 Why Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a great starting point for machine learning because it directly relates to the classic line equation:

`y = mX + c` <br/>
Where:
- `m` is the slope (coefficient)
- `c` is the y-intercept

This project helped reinforce the mathematical intuition behind this equation and understand how machine learning models make predictions based on such logic.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Built and evaluated a Linear Regression model from scratch
- Understood the internal working of linear models
- Learned the process of training and testing a machine learning model
- Gained hands-on experience with libraries like `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`
- Strengthened my understanding of feature relationships and regression evaluation metrics
